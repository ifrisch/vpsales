# Van Paper Business Hours Automation Summary

## 🕐 NEW SCHEDULE OVERVIEW

**Automatic scans every 2 hours during business hours:**
- **Monday - Friday Only**
- **7:30 AM** - First scan of the day
- **9:30 AM** - Mid-morning scan  
- **11:30 AM** - Pre-lunch scan
- **1:30 PM** - Afternoon scan
- **3:30 PM** - Final scan of the day

**Weekends:** No scans (automation resumes Monday)

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

1. **Smart Scanning**: Looks for Van Paper emails from the last 3 hours
2. **Flexible Processing**: If report found → processes and updates app
3. **Quiet Operation**: If no report → logs "no new reports" and exits
4. **Live Updates**: https://vpsales.streamlit.app/ updates within 2-3 minutes

## 🚀 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### Run in Administrator PowerShell:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Isaac\OneDrive - Van Paper Company\Python_Projects\Sales_Leaderboard"
.\setup_business_hours.ps1
```

This will create 5 scheduled tasks:
- Van Paper 7:30 AM Scan
- Van Paper 9:30 AM Scan  
- Van Paper 11:30 AM Scan
- Van Paper 1:30 PM Scan
- Van Paper 3:30 PM Scan

## ✅ BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH

- **Flexible**: Catches reports regardless of exact send time
- **Reliable**: Multiple check points ensure nothing is missed
- **Efficient**: Only runs during business hours, weekdays only
- **Smart**: Looks back 3 hours so overlapping scans catch everything
- **Quiet**: No errors or notifications when no reports are found

## 🔍 MONITORING

- **Task Scheduler**: See all 5 "Van Paper [Time] Scan" tasks
- **Live App**: Check https://vpsales.streamlit.app/ for updates
- **File System**: Look for new backup files when reports are processed

## 📊 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

- **7:30 AM & 2:00 PM**: Van Paper sends reports (your current schedule)
- **Next scan after each report**: Finds and processes automatically
- **Between reports**: Scans run but find nothing (normal operation)
- **Weekends**: No scans, system rests
- **Holidays**: Scans run but likely find nothing (Van Paper probably doesn't send)

Your sales leaderboard will now stay automatically updated throughout business hours! 🎉
